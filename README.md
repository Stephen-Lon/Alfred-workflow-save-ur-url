# Alfred-workflow-save-ur-url
Save a selected URL to a text file (appending if the file exists)

# Introduction

Sometimes when browsing you want to save a URL quickly for future reference without creating a bookmark in your browser. That is what this workflow does. For simplicity it uses a simple plain text file (which will be created for you if it doesn't already exist) to which saved URLs will be appended. You select the location folder for that file in the workflow configuration opposite.

# Usage

Using your Universal Action hotkey on a selected URL, select `Save URL to links file` from the list and press ‚èé. You will then be prompted for a description of the URL (which may be a useful reminder). Type the description and press ‚èé. If you wish you can leave the description blank by simply pressing ‚èé.

The result will be a text file (which you can open in your default text file editor.

# Notes

1. In the workflow configuration you can choose the keyword you wish to use to open the Links.txt file.

2. If (quite understandably üòÄ) you loathe the sound effect you can, of course, mute it in the workflow configuration.
